# Title: Reputation and Node Selection

## Abstract

Node selection is the process wherein the set of all possible storage nodes is reduced by the satellite for uploading segments.  Node selection applies to new file uploads via an uplink, as well as repair traffic from a satellite.  The node selection processes endeavors to fairly distribute upload traffic among storage nodes.  Node selection takes into consideration how new a node is, the overall performance characteristic of a storage node as characterized by its reputation score, and the IP address of each node.
