Design doc process:

Design docs will be checked in as Markdown files in storj/storj/docs/design.

Design docs should have an editor/author, at least one design Q&A meeting, and at least two reviewers from the architecture board.

The editor is the primary person responsible for the design doc - they're responsible for soliciting authors or authoring the document themselves (drafting could be in Google Docs). The editor is responsible for scheduling the Q&A meeting(s), getting the document reviewed, and getting the document merged into the repo. Editor is also responsible for making a list of epics and tickets to file once merged and posting the design doc in our [fourm](https://forum.storj.io/c/engineer-amas/design-draft)

The reviewers are responsible for saying that the design doc looks good to them, have no objections, and are ready to turn the document into tickets.

The Q&A meeting should have at least 3 people but no more than 6. Invitees should have read what parts of document currently exist prior and be prepared to discuss it and the design space. The reviewers should be present. There should be at least one Q&A meeting where the result is everyone is happy with the design, but potentially more if a Q&A meeting ends with unsolved problems.

One of the reviewers must be an "architecture owner." At minimum, the following people currently count:

  * Egon (egonelbre)
  * Kaloyan (kaloyan-raev)
  * JT (jtolds)
  * Jens (littleskunk)
  
Until we develop our own institutional knowledge of running V3 at scale, one of the reviewers should be someone with significant external distributed systems industry experience. At minimum, the following people currently count:

  * Paul (thepaul)
  * Simon (simongui)
  * Jeff (zeebo)
  * Matt (brimstone)

We'll list these people as GitHub codeowners, but it is expected editors solicit input from the wider engineering team, the devops team, the data science team, the UX team, and QA.
