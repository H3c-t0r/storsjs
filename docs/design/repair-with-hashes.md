# Repair using Piece Hashes

## Abstract

The satellite should repair files also using piece hashes to minimize CPU and bandwidth load.

## Background

Piece hashes Data repair is an ongoing, costly operation that will use significant bandwidth, memory, and processing power, often impacting a single operator. As a result, repair resource usage should be aggressively minimized as much as possible.

For repairing a segment to be eective at minimizing bandwidth usage, only as few pieces as needed for reconstruction should be downloaded. Unfortunately, Reed-Solomon is insucient on its own for correcting errors when only a few redundant pieces are provided. Instead, piece hashes provide a better way to be confident that weâ€™re repairing the data correctly.

To solve this problem, hashes of every piece will be stored alongside each piece on each storage node. A validation hash that the set of hashes is correct will be stored in the pointer. During repair, the hashes of every piece can be retrieved and validated for correctness against the pointer, thus allowing each piece to be validated in its entirety. This allows the repair system to correctly assess whether or not repair has been completed successfully without using extra redundancy for the same task.
