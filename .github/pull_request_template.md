## Code Review Checklist
 * Does the PR describe what changes are being made?
 * Does the code follow the [Effective Go style guide](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html)?
 * Does the new code have enough documentation? (comments and or diagrams)
 * Does the new code have enough tests? (*every* PR should have tests or justification otherwise. Bug-fix PRs especially)
