# gRPC Client + BoltDB Crud Interface

This is an example gRPC client which makes requests for updating and storing farmer stats in BoltDB.

The gRPC server at `storj.io/storj/cmd/statdb/main.go` needs to be running for this to work.

To run the client:
```
go run examples/statdb-client/main.go
```
You can change the port number with a flag if necessary: `-port=<port-number>`

Afterward, you can use [Bolter](https://github.com/hasit/bolter) or a similar BoltDB viewer to make sure your pointer entries were changed as expected.

If changes are made to `storj.io/storj/protos/statdb/statdb.proto`, the protobuf file will need to be regenerated by running `go generate` inside `protos/statdb`.

Tests for this example code can be found in `storj.io/storj/pkg/statdb/statdb_test.go`.
